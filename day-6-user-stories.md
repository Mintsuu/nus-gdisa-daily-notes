# User Stories (Requirement and Project Scoping)

## Project Scope Boundary

### User Stories
- A tool used by AGILE software development to describe a software feature from end-user perspective 
- Helps to create a simplified description of a requirement
- Written in simple English sentences
- Fill in gaps of user stories by supplementing additional user stories
- Include time in user stories


#### Sample Persona:
```
- Give brief description of the user persona

Ideal Features:
- Describe features that could help the persona's personality

Frustration:
- Describe roadblocks/issues that the persona may face 
```

#### User Story Template:
```
As a "role", I would like to "feature" so that "purpose".

E.g. 
- As a `supervisor`, I would like to have `a view of today's transactions` so that `I can identify the market trend and compare today's sales with another day`.
- As a `library user`, I will `receive an email reminder 2 days before the due date` so that I `can return my books`.
- As a `library user`, I can `register with my email address, phone number` so that I `can be contacted`.
- As a `customer`, I can `make special requests for my booking` so that I `can extend my trip`.
```

### Epics vs Themes vs Stories
- Epics: Groups of user stories that are needed to form a completed workflow
- Theme: Groups of user stories that are related e.g. similar in function, involved task done by the same user

## Workshop Steps:
1) Primary task --> Translate into user stories 
2) Identify 1 pain point --> List down all necessary user stories for that pain point

- Doesn't matter how many user stories
- See how many pain points can be resolved
- Finish by 5pm
## Questions
- Can you do inverted stories? "As a _______, I cannot _______ so that ________" 
(Nope, this exercise is used to describe features of the program. Limitations will be dealt during other parts of the software development exercise.)
