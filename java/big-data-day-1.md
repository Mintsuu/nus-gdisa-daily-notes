  - Variety: 
  - Velocity: 
  - Value:

  - Variability: 

  ## Big Data Types 
  - Structured Data: SQL, rigid
  - Unstructured Data: JSON, do not follow a specific format 
  - Semi-structured Data: images, pdfs, mp3s 

## Batch Processing vs Stream Processing 
- Batch Processing: Process data at once at a fixed schedule 
- Stream Processing: Process data in real-time 

## Personal Key Notes 
- Traditional data (e.g. data in the GBs or TBs): Store in relational database 
- Big Data (e.g. in PBs or EBs): Store in distributed file systems (e.g. Amazon S3, HDFS)
- Scaling strategies:
  - Scale up: Improve technical capabilities (e.g. CPU, storage)
  - Scale out: Increase number of nodes aka distributed systems
