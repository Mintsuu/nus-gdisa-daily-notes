#### Sample Exam Question
```
The encryption method used in Caesar cipher is described as follows. It involves shifting each letter in a plain text by three letters forward:

`A -> D, B -> E, C -> F, etc...`

At the end of the alphabet, it wraps around the end, therefore: 

`X -> A, Y -> B, Z -> C`

Only letters are encrypted, numbers and other characters remain the same during encryption. 

For example, the string "10 ZEBRAS" will be encrypted as "10 CHEUDV".

You are required to write a simple Caesar cipher program, which can rea dinput sentence from user, encrypt and decrypt it, as well as print the output to screen. 


Method Specification
The program is written as a class with a static Main() method shown in the following figure which uses other methods that has to be written. 
```

``` 

public class #6_Quiz_Q2 {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        String upperPlainText = ReturnUpperInputSentence();
        String encryptedText = EncryptSentence(upperPlainText);
        PrintEncryptedSentence(encryptedText);
    }
}
