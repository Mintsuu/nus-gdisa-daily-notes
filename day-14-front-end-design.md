# Design 
## Mental Model vs Conceptual Model 
- Mental Model: 
  - Internal understanding in users mind on how it should work
- Conceptual Model: 
  - The conceptual design of the system 
- Good conceptual models focus on helping useres to establish a mental model of the system 
- Better to use real world metaphors to improve conceptual model design 

## Contextual Design
- Used to get the context of which the target audience is currently in and design your application based on that 

## Objects vs Actions 
- Object = 
- Actions = actions you can take on the object/product
