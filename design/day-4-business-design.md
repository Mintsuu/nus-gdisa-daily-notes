# Requirement & Project Scoping

## Data-driven vs Data-informed
- Data-informed: Data is one of several inputs in design decisions
- Data-driven: Data is the only input in design decisions

## Data-informed Design
- Descriptive: What just happened?
- Diagnostic: Why did something happen in the past?
- Predictive: What should happen next?
- Prescriptive: What should happen in the future? (Responding to predictions)
    - Root Cause Analysis (RCA): Collect and analyse the root causes of a problem
    - System Performance: Through-put, response time, crash rates, system availability
    - Software Metrics: Total code churn, defect density, mean time between failure/to detect/ to resolve

Descriptive | Library users past borrowing records, overdue records and complaints | Identify the reason for overdue so to prevent future cases
