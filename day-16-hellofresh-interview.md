# Promoter User Stories 
As a promoter, I can view information related to the product form so that I can price the shelved products accurately and arrange the products as instructed by the branch manager.
As a promoter, I can view the location of any products so that I can find the actual product location to restock goods if necessary 
As a promoter, 


# Storeman 1
Come in at 7am
Wait for delivery
Take the delivery and put it inside the store 

Promoters will tell them to take it out put it out in the store
There's shipments in the morning and afternoon 

Mostly physical work 
Have to use end-of-day sales report to update record
 
Too many products that comes 

Perishables comes in the morning (to sell)
Non-perishables can come anytime, but there's only 1 loading and unloading bay, storeman informs them when to come 
Promoters will inform the storeman when and where to put the items in the store 
Jerry and him are the only storemen, they do all of the physical work 
Inventory record used to count the number of things in the store
Countercheck the items using the inventory record to make sure numbers are the same 
During festive seasons, higher discrepencies 
Main issue of discrepencies --> cashier count wrong, promoter label wrong, someone steal, not storeman's fault 
Sometimes promoter will sometimes take expired food to cook and give to customers (not too long away from expiry)
Staff is allowed to take the expired food

Orders are all through the phone 
Number on inventory record
Edward will determine how much to order 
Normally when they order, Jerry and him will check against what they ordered 
If expired/dented they will reject 

Perishables will all be sent to the store 
Early morning at 7am, super market opens 7:30am 8am 

Process to determine when to stock:
- Promoter determines how many cnas and quantity 
- Storeman will check and give the promoter based on their requirements
- which is why errors can't be from the storeman 

When there is low amount of products, Edward has a product form 

Storeman doesn't care about the classifications of products, but sometimes stock

Products arae very heavy, difficult to transport 
Trolley not good enough cause its too heavy 

Have to redo the product classifications 
A lot of work to do inventory management

Need evidence of stock management to prove that the storemen's work has been conducted 
Very hard to verify whether the stock has been delivered cause must get verification from promoters

# Storeman 2
2 shifts - Mickey and Donald works on afternoon shift 
Edward plans the shift 

Morning shift more loading/unloading since there's a lot of the fresh produce 
Evening shift a lot more updates to do the inventory record 
End of day sales report must come first before they cna do the inventory record 
Both shifts workload about the same 
Better to have more storeman, need about 4 per shift 
Mostly heavy work, and counting is very tedious 

Inventory record is card, 1 item 1 card 
Each department seems to have a card, e.g. supermarket, store, etc 
Storeman will subtract and add based on the movement of goods 
This is also where they keep an overview of the products (whether need to replenish or not)
Inventory record is a big binder 
There are color coded categories 
Edward also has access to the inventory record 
Promoters cannot enter the store, cause it might disrupt the counting since they won't be able to record on the inventory record 

Monthly inventory check, supermarket is closed and hte storeman will count in the store, and the promoters will count the ones in the supermarket (once a month, end of month)
Number outside must tally with inventory and how many sold 

Promoters will infrom storeman if products are damaged or expired 
Promoters sometimes throw away items without informing the storeman which causes discrepencies 
Communication is mainly through forms 
Edward will also work as their spokesperson 

Prodcut form is a spreadsheet 
Product form is a physical form 

Phone call to suppliers 
Supplieres will take delivery note 
Storeman will file the delivery note 
Edward will check the delivery notes and use it to pay the suppliers 
Theres only a few suppliers 

Suppliers will visit every day or week 

Handover only consists of handing over the key 
Delivery note if not updated, it'll be placed aside until they have time to deal with it 

Forms don't get lost
