## Java Autobox
- Converts primitive types into their object wrapper class (e.g. `int` to `Integer`)

## Comparison between generics
- There is a built in generic interface `Comparable<T>` that has a `.compareTo()` method that is built in with most native classes in Java 
- Can extend generic types with this interface to compare between generics 

## Generics 
- T is usually short for type 
- E is usually short for element
