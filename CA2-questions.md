# Questions 
- Why do we need more than 1 class diagram for each use case? Shouldn't it just be 1 
Separate the related entities related to the use case 

- Do we need to separate the database ERD and the class diagram? They're essentially the same thing
Yes still need, cause the database attributes will sometimes be different from the class diagrams 

- What is the design model? 
Design model is only if your class diagram has inheritances or not (not required, but include if you need it) 

- When will we know our results from the CA and the exams? 
Results will be released a couple weeks into term 2
