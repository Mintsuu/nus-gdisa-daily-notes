## Series
- 1D array are called series
- `s.iloc[x]`: access by index position can use array slicing to select multiple elements
- `s.loc[x]`: access by key name can also use array slicing to select multiple elements `s.loc['john':'james']`

## DataFrames
- 2D array with index and column names
- `df = pd.Dataframe([1,2,3], columns = [], index = [])` 


## Exam Notes
- Important to know how to convert to series
