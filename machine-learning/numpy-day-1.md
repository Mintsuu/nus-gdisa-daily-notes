## Self Notes 
- O(N2) etc. is called algorithm complexity 
- When showing examples of arrays and how to target indexes, don't use 1,2,3,4,5 as values as it's confusing with index. Use like 10,50,20,40 or something.

## Exam Notes 
- Numpy array reshaping not tested in exams (switching between array dimensions)
- Array slicing is important in general 
- Understanding axises (e.g. 1 = column, 0 = rows)
- Search and sort is important 
- Just print out the jupyter notebooks as the cheatsheets for exams

## Things to ask
- Check if he has any materials to read up on understanding the mathematics behind machine learning
