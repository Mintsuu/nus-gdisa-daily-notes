# Database Analysis and Design 
## Data Dictionary
- No need to go in depth (e.g. specifying the data types as `VARCHAR`) since this is the high-level interpretation of the data model 
- Mainly to describe how the table is supposed to look like 

## Database Normalisation Steps 
### 0NF 
- No normalisation applied

### 1NF
- Refactor multivalue attributes (e.g. Remove OrderDetail from Order)
- Move multivalue/repeating group to a new entity 

### 2NF 
-
