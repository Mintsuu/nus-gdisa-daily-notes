# Java Primitives & Reference Types 

## Reference types 
- Uses the memory address to point to the object 
- Memory address is saved, not the actual value 

## Primitive Types 
- Actually saves the value 

## Static vs Non-static 
- Static methods/variables do not need the object to be instantiated to be used (e.g. a library of functions)
- Non-static methods/variables require the object to be instantiated to be used (e.g. class Animal)
